Comprehensive Personality Assessment

Overview

This project is a Comprehensive Personality Assessment tool, designed to provide detailed insights into a user's personality profile based on established psychological frameworks. It includes 60 questions across various categories, such as Cognitive Styles, Emotional Patterns, Social Dynamics, and Personality Variants.

The tool is intended for use by psychotherapists, counselors, and individuals interested in a deeper understanding of their personality. The results include a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) classification, ambiversion status, social role, and a variant classification (e.g., Turbulent or Assertive).

How It Works

The tool calculates the user's MBTI type by analyzing responses across different dimensions like introversion/extraversion and thinking/feeling.

The ambiversion status is determined based on a balance between introversion and extraversion scores.

The social role (e.g., Alpha, Sigma) is derived from a combination of scores in the social and cognitive dimensions.

The variant (Turbulent vs. Assertive) is based on emotional responses, reflecting how users handle stress and change.


Customization

To modify the appearance or functionality, you can edit the complete_personality_assessment.html file directly.

CSS changes can be made within the <style> tags to alter the styling.

JavaScript functions like calculateMBTI() and renderChart() can be modified for custom calculation logic or to use a different charting library.
